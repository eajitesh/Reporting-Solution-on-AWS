# AWS Services for Reporting Databases

Following can be used to host the reporting database:

* AWS RDS options such as MySQL
* AWS ElasticSearch
* AWS RedShift

## AWS ElasticSearch 

The advantage of using [AWS ELasticSearch (ES)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/) is that it could fulfill multiple requirements:

* Faster full-text search
* Analytics using Kibana owing to the built-in integration with [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)

The primary reason to go with AWS ES is built-in integrations with Kibana, Logstash, and AWS services including Amazon Kinesis Firehose, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch so that you can go from raw data to actionable insights quickly. The very fact that Kibana supports shareable embeds makes it more lucrative option. Also, it is a breeze to create reports using Kibana.
